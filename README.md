#Konga

An opinionated Koa/AngularJS boilerplate.

## Dependencies

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)    

###Dev Dependencies

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)  

###Dependency Notes

Konga's uses [Koa](http://koajs.com/), which requires Node 0.11.9 or greater, and that Node be run with the `--harmony` flag. See [Koa](http://koajs.com/) documentation for additional notes.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

There is a "Comments" component included within the Koa boilerplate. You will probably want to remove or modify this component.

There is a functional Google Analytics component included within the AngularJS boilerplate.

## Known Issues

Sourcemaps are a disaster -- related gulp.js functionality will change as modules and underlying libraries mature.
